<h2>PERSONAL REVIEW </h2>

<p class="ketam"><i>With the existence of Canva, life has definitely become much easier, especially for someone like me who used to rely heavily on PowerPoint for editing presentations. As a university student, I've always found PowerPoint to be a useful tool, but it often felt a bit limiting in terms of design flexibility and visual appeal. The templates were basic, and while it had some design options, they did not allow for the same level of creativity or polish that I was looking for. That is where Canva has been a game-changer. Switching to Canva has made my presentation creation process faster, more efficient, and much more fun. Canva has definitely mada a huge difference in how I approach design, and I honestly can not imagine going back to PowerPoint now~ </i></p>
