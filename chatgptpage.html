            <h3>WHAT IS A CHATGPT?</h3>
            <p class="ketam">
              ChatGPT is a sophisticated AI chatbot developed by OpenAl. It stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer and its primary function is to generate human-like responses in natural language, based on the text it is given. It is designed to engage in conversations, answer questions, and help with a variety of tasks, such as writing, explaining ideas, or offering suggestions. It works by analysing the text you enter and generating responses that sound like they are coming from a human. You can use it for learning, problem-solving, or simply chatting. In the field of education, ChatGPT is being utilised to create smart tutoring systems that offer personalized support to students.
