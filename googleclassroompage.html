<h2>BENEFITS OF GOOGLE CLASSROOM</h2>
<br>
<h5>FOR TEACHERS</h5>
<h6><b>Easy Access to Resources</b></h6>
<p class="ketam">-	Google Classroom helps teachers to provide easy access to a variety of educational resources. It is because teachers can upload documents, videos, links to external websites, or images making sure that students have all the materials they need in one place. This is particularly useful for distance or hybrid learning environments where students may not have immediate access to in-person resources. In one app, students can have all the access in one go.<p>
<h6><b>Centralised Grading System</b></h6>
<p class="ketam">-	Google Classroom provides a centralised location where all assignments, grades, and feedback are stored. Teachers can access a single platform to view students' submitted work, grade assignments, and keep track of the overall progress of the class. This reduces the need for multiple tools or spreadsheets and allows for easy, organized record-keeping For instance, when teachers create assignments, students can attach rubrics, provide instructions, and set due dates all in one place.</p>
<br>
<h5>FOR STUDENTS</h5>

<h6><b>Accessibility</b></h6>
<p class="ketam">-	Google Classroom provides students with the ability to access their assignments and course materials from any device with an internet
 
connection. Whether using a computer, tablet, or smartphone, students can engage with their coursework anytime and from anywhere. This feature is particularly valuable for students who may not have regular access to physical classrooms or those who need to study or complete assignments outside of school hours. As a result, learning becomes more flexible and it is not confined to a specific classroom environment.<p>
<h6><b>Accountability</b></h6>
<p class="ketam">-	Google Classroom helps students to be more responsible for their learning by giving them clear visibility into their assignments, deadlines, and grades. By having access to all their work in one place, students can track their progress, ensure they meet deadlines, and submit assignments on time. This transparency promotes accountability, encouraging students to manage their time effectively and stay on top of their responsibilities. Through regular reviews of their performance and feedback, students also learn to improve and take proactive steps in their educational journey.<p>

<h2>PERSONAL REVIEW</h2>

It offers a well-structured and user-friendly platform that allows me to easily track assignments, deadlines, and feedback, which has significantly improved my time management and helped me stay on top of my studies. The option to collaborate in real-time with classmates on shared documents, along with the ability to access materials anytime and from any location, has made learning more flexible and effective. Furthermore, the prompt feedback from teachers allows me to consistently refine my work, and the use of digital tools has enhanced my technical skills. Overall, Google Classroom promotes a more organised and collaborative approach to learning.</i></p>
